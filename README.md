# DumDumBird

DumDumBird is a Next.js-based game inspired by "Flappy Bird," incorporating TypeScript, Lua, and Arweave for a decentralized and engaging experience. The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and is deployed on Vercel.

## Features
- **Next.js Framework**: Provides a high-performance web experience.
- **Lua Scripting**: Game logic are managed with Lua scripts.
- **AO The Computer**: Runs processes that compute Lua functions to support gameplay mechanics.
- **Arweave Integration**: Stores player high scores permanently on the blockchain.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Serverless deployment with Vercel.


## Arweave Integration
The project leverages Arweave, utilizing @permaweb/aoconnect and arweave for wallet connection, high-score storage, and balance retrieval to create a decentralized leaderboard.

## AO The Computer
"AO the Computer" computes .lua functions to dynamically process game mechanics, making real-time adjustments based on player input and performance.


This README includes the roles of Arweave and AO in processing Lua functions for gameplay, helping to clarify these features for users and developers.
